### Movies
#### Best
**The Apartment (1960) dir. Billy Wilder**
<br>
This one really grew on me. Dialogue is so snappy and satirical you almost forget about the emotional depth.

#### Unexpected
**Clue (1985) dir. Jonathan Lynn**
<br>
Hilarious. I thought it would find it far too caricature-y but it was a joy.

#### Not for Me
**Frances Ha (2012) dir. Noah Baumbach**
<br>
Quirky girl in NYC genre is just not for me.

### Books
#### Best
**Sevastopol by Emilio Fraia**
<br>
Moving portraits in the short story form.

#### Nerdy Niche
**Helgoland: making sense of the quantum revolution by Carlo Rovelli**
<br>
Who doesn't love getting lost in the stars.

#### Would Recommend
**Eros the bittersweet, Anne Carson**
<br>
Anne Carson never wrote a bad sentence in her life.

### Music
#### On Repeat
**Man Of The Year, ScHoolboy Q**
<br>
Without a doubt my top gym song of the month.

#### Shared with Me
**When The Lights Go, Totally Enormous Extinct Dinosaurs**
<br>
My friend shared this album with me because they thought it would fit with my love of The Radio Dept. They were right.

#### Throwback
**Long Live (Taylor's Version), Taylor Swift**
<br>
Is this technically a throwback?

Happy reading, watching, and listening!
